CHANGES
=======

Version 0.2 to Version 0.1
--------------------------
* No significant changes.  The version number was bumped for the release
  of FX2, which uses Elision.

Version 0.1 to Current
----------------------
* There is now a pager ("more") automatically used when output exceeds the
  screen size.
* Bug fixes for handling of "quiet."

Version 0.0 to Version 0.1
--------------------------
* The old REPL has been replaced with the new REPL.  Startup times are much
  slower, but lots of good customization is present and the system is more
  flexible.
* The system now supports properties, replacing many of the output control
  operators (like stacktrace and showscala).  Use listprops() to see the
  properties, and setprop(name,value) to set them.
* The system now uses a search path to find files.  The search path is
  given by the ELISION_PATH environment variable in the same style as any
  other path on your platform.
* Bootstrap files can be overridden by files in the search path.
* The system now reads the ELISIONRC environment variable to find a file
  to read after bootstrapping.  If this is not set, it looks for a
  .elisionrc or elision.ini in the home folder and reads that if found.
  The search path is used if ELISIONRC is specified and not absolute.
